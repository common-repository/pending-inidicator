== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Activated the plugin but nothing happens?<br />
You do not see any pending indicators until you really have a pending post (of any type) waiting or approval, an indicator will be displayed as soon as there is one. If you want to try it out, create a post of your own and save it as pending for review.
